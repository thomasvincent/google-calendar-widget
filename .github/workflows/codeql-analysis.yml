        # Specify the query suites to run. 'security-extended' covers more CVEs and security weaknesses.
        # 'security-and-quality' includes security queries plus maintainability and reliability queries.

        # Default is 'security-extended' if not specified.
        queries: security-extended,security-and-quality
        # Example: To use custom queries, uncomment the following lines:
        # config-file: ./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
        # queries: +security-and-quality, +path/to/custom/queries
        # The '+' prefix adds specified queries to those defined in the config file or default suites.

    # Auto-build is not needed for interpreted languages like JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby.
    # If you were analyzing a compiled language (C/C++, C#, Go, Java, Swift) and the default
    # Autobuild step failed, you would insert your custom build steps here.
    # Example for a JS/TS project requiring a build step (e.g., `npm run build`):
    # - name: Build JavaScript/TypeScript project (if needed)
    #   run: |
    #     npm install
    #     npm run build # Replace with your actual build command if CodeQL needs to observe it
