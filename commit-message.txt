fix(ci): add missing PHPCS dependencies and fix test propagation

- Add phpcsstandards/phpcsutils and phpcsstandards/phpcsextra dependencies to GitHub Actions workflows
- Update installed_paths configuration to include new dependencies
- Fix run-tests.sh to properly propagate test failures with set -e

This resolves the failing GitHub Actions by adding the missing dependencies required by the newer versions of WordPress Coding Standards and ensuring tests properly fail when they should.

Fixes #123
