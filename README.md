## Usage

### Getting a Google API Key

2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Calendar API for your project
4. Create an API key
5. Restrict the API key to your domain for security
6. Enter the API key in the plugin settings (Settings > Google Calendar Widget)

### Widget Settings

- **Calendar Title**: The title displayed above the calendar events
- **Maximum Results**: The maximum number of events to display (1-50)
- **Expand Entries by Default**: Whether to show event details by default
- **Calendar IDs**: The ID(s) of the Google Calendar(s) to display events from
  - You can find the Calendar ID in your Google Calendar settings
  - You can add multiple Calendar IDs by separating them with commas
- **Event Title Format**: Customize how event titles are displayed

### Event Title Format

Use the following placeholders in the Event Title Format field:
- `[TITLE]`: The event title
- `[STARTTIME]`: The start time (or "All Day" for all-day events)
- `[ENDTIME]`: The end time (blank for all-day events)

You can also include additional text within the brackets, which will only appear if the value exists. For example, `[STARTTIME - ][TITLE]` will display the start time followed by a dash and a space, but only if there is a start time.

## FAQ

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
2. Click on the three dots next to the calendar name in the left sidebar
3. Select "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll down to "Integrate calendar"

### Can I display events from multiple calendars?

Yes, you can display events from up to three different calendars. Enter each Calendar ID in the widget settings, or separate multiple IDs with commas in a single field.

### Does this plugin work with private calendars?

The plugin works with public calendars by default. To display events from private calendars, you would need to implement additional authentication methods, which are not currently supported in this version of the plugin.

This plugin follows WordPress security best practices:

- All user inputs are properly sanitized and validated
- All outputs are properly escaped
